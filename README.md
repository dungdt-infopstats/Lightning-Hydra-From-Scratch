# Pytorch Lightning Hydra From Scratch
This repository is the reimplementation of [Pytorch Lightning Hydra](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/hydra.html) from scratch. It is a simple and easy-to-understand implementation that can be used as a reference for learning how to use Hydra with Pytorch Lightning.

## Installation
You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install lightning
pip install hydra-core
```

## Flow
The flow of the implementation is as follows:
1. Follow the instruction in [Level Up](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) to study the basic usage of Pytorch Lightning.
2. Follow the project structure in Lightning-Hydra to create the necessary files and folders.
3. Implement the necessary code in each file to achieve the desired functionality.
4. Test the implementation to ensure it works as expected.
5. Refractor code with Hydra to make it more flexible and configurable.
6. Test the implementation again to ensure it works as expected with Hydra.
